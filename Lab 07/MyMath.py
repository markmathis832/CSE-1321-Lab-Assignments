# Program MyMath.py

# Inside of MyMath.py, write the following methods:
# `my_max` which takes in two number values and returns the largest between the two inputs.
# `my_min` which takes in two number values and returns the smallest between the two inputs.
# `my_avg` which takes in two number values and returns the calculated mean average of the two inputs.

def my_max(num1, num2):
    return max(num1, num2)

def my_min(num1, num2):
    return min(num1, num2)

def my_avg(num1, num2):
    return (num1 + num2) / 2
